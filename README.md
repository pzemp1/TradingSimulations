# Trading Simulations
Created a simple framework for testing the efficacy of a strategy. 

The Python code automates the simulation of trading.

I only implemented naive strategies just using moving averages. I explored other strategies such as the use of gaussian filters to create signals too. More strategies can be implemented but that is not the point. The point of this file was to get used to coding on python, interacting with pandas library, utilising data too. I also use algorithms like DTW to look at the similarity of time series graphs, and I have code to compare them with what cosine similarity and RMSE indicates too. However, more so this was a good opportunity for me to get used to using plotly which is very useful for data analysis.  It also was centered around an idea of randomised approval of entry and exit signals. 

Other miscellanous things I looked at were the optimal buying and selling points and other smoothing techniques such as gaussian smoothing.
